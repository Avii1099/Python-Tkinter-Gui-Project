The author of the book 'Ambedkar', is a member of The Planning Commission,
an establishment totally or almost totally lacking creativity, innovation
or imagination. Professor Jadhav is a distinguished exception. He studied
in the United States, obtaining PhD in Economics. The last worthwhile book 
on Ambedkar was written by Dr. Dhananjay Keer. It was published in 1954. 
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was arguably among the most brilliant Indian intellectuals 
of the 20th century. His life is a triumph of character over circumstances.
